**** Usage ****
                   
when this app  is executed for the first time you will be asked to show the locations of the pre requisites. 
and once done the app will save the paths and the user wont be asked again for this.
in addition to this, once run the first time the user has to run the configurations by clicking on "configurations" button,
this will install the needed packages (it takes from 5 to 15 min and need to be done only once).
after completing these 2 steps, the user each time only needs to run AJAN but clicking on "Start AJAN" button,
the AJAN web application will be automatically opened in the default browser.
